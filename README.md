Book Alchemy is a small, purpose-built web application for managing a personal book collection. It emphasizes clarity over complexity: clean routes, simple templates, 
and straightforward CRUD so you can add, edit, and organize titles without friction. The goal of the project was to practice end-to-end fundamentals—structuring a Python web app, modeling data, 
wiring up forms and validation, and shipping a responsive UI that stays out of the way. It’s intentionally minimal, making it an easy codebase to extend with features like pagination, tags/genres, 
cover uploads, and user accounts. 
(Repo language breakdown: Python with HTML & CSS.)
